## Welcome
There are many different CI/CD models available for use, we've included details for those we've had opportunity to work with.
- GitHub Actions

## TL;DR
1. create a repository for your CI/CD use
2. clone the directory that is relevant to you, for example `/examples-gke/github-actions/`
3. create a dedicated runner (public or private)
4. update the scripting (as defined in the commentary) for your cluster
5. run the service deployment

## Developer Guidance
If you find something missing, feel free to contribute to any of our documentation files, or write new ones.

This is a work in progress as we learn what we'll need to provide people in order to be effective contributors to our project. 

Be sure to review the following:  
* [Coding Style](/doc/STYLE.md)
* [Contribution Guidelines](/doc/CONTRIBUTE.md)
