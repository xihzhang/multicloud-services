# Getting Started
We've included a basic deployment to help get started.
Consult with our [documentation](https://all.docs.genesys.com/GWS/Current/GWSPEGuide/Overview) for the full configuration and deployment details.

## TL;DR
- Complete the prequisites if any.
- Adjust the `chart.ver` to the release you wish to deploy.
- Adjust the `override_values.yaml` to suit your environment and needs.
- Run the github actions workflow.

## Configuration

Be sure to update the values defined to align with your environment.
To use the scripting for service deployment, create a deployment secret (deployment-secrets) to store confidential information you may not want held in your repository, or `.yaml` files.
