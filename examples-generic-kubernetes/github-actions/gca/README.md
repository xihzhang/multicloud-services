# Getting Started
We've included a basic deployment to help get started.
Consult with our [documentation](all.docs.genesys.com/PEC-REP/Current/GIMPEGuide/Overview) for the full configuration and deployment details.

## TL;DR
- Complete the prequisites if any.
- Adjust the `chart.ver` to the release you wish to deploy.
- Adjust the `override_values.yaml` to suit your environment and needs.
- Create the required secrets.
- Run the github actions workflow.

## Configuration

Be sure to update the values defined to align with your environment.
To use the scripting for service deployment, create a deployment secret (deployment-secrets) to store confidential information you may not want held in your repository, or `.yaml` files. 

:memo: **gca** deployment relies on `deployment secrets` of **tenant**, **gim**, and **gsp** in their corresponding namespaces.

## Secrets 
Create the standard [pullsecret](../#-considerations) for the workflow: 
`secrets/pullsecret`

## Additional Information

Our sample configurations include the optional monitoring capabilities. For implementation of dashboards and monitoring see the [tools section](/tools).

Be sure to check your ingress details as per [ingress documentation](/doc/ingress.md).
